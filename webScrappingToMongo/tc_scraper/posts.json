First, she released \u201cRed,\u201d an album about heartbreak and hurt, while I was in the thick of high school. My now-retired Tumblr is still thankful. More recently, Swift took on a project to rerecord her earlier albums, reclaiming her music from her old record label \u2014 this time with her own ownership as a key difference. Her first rerecording, of \u201cFearless\u201d \u2014 annotated with \u201c(Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d \u2014 came out this year.\n\nOf course, I think there\u2019s a pretty obvious tech angle here. Swift made a statement on artist empowerment and the importance of singer-owned music \u2014 record labels be damned \u2014 the same year that we saw tech defined by the Great Resignation, emerging entrepreneurs and distributed work. Like Swift, I think the tech scene is going through an uncomfortable period of changing their minds, questioning authority and getting closer to self-advocacy as a result.\n\nLooking back, I unlearned a lot about startups this year, especially when it comes to due diligence, formalization and what it means to be contrarian.\n\nWhen Spark Capital decided to \u201csever all ties\u201d with David Dobrik\u2019s Dispo app weeks after leading a deal in the company, I immediately thought that it would set precedent across the venture capital industry. The move was triggered by a Business Insider investigation that exposed allegations from a woman who said that a member of Dobrik\u2019s Vlog Squad sexually assaulted her.\n\nIn some ways, I was right: Unshackled Ventures and Seven Seven Six chose to step away from the company as well, donating any profits from their respective investments to organizations focused on survivors of sexual assault. In other ways, I was not. It\u2019s clear that there continues to be a disconnect between what happened with Dispo and the world of fast-moving due diligence.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/11/what-i-unlearned-about-startups-this-year/"},
{"title": "5 things you may have missed in Atomico\u2019s 2021 Europe report", "author": "Alex Wilhelm", "published_at": "2021-12-10 09:30:04", "content": "Europe, long viewed as a relative backwater to the U.S. startup market, has been on a tear in recent quarters and years. Akin to many startup markets around the world, Europe has seen its venture capital totals rise, its unicorn ranks swell, and even a few major public exits.\n\nHow hot is the market for European startups this year? This morning, TechCrunch reported that Flink raised $750 million. The \u201cBerlin-based startup that sells food and other essentials at supermarket prices and aims to deliver them in under 10 minutes,\u201d as we described it, is now worth $2.85 billion. And unless you are very familiar with the instant grocery market, we doubt that you were too aware of Flink.\n\nThe European startup market is now sufficiently robust and varied that it\u2019s easy to lose track of its unicorns.\n\nThe Exchange explores startups, markets and money. \n\nRead it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n\nThe Exchange has been tracking Europe\u2019s startup acceleration for years now. So, consider our general delight when Atomico, a European venture fund, and Dealroom, a data-tracker with a solid European data set, dropped a huge sheaf of numbers concerning its performance earlier this week.\n\nTied up as we were with our book guides (here\u00a0and here), we\u2019re just now getting to the data. So, instead of snagging just high-level numbers that paint a more general picture, we\u2019re teasing out a few things that you might have missed in your own read. If you care about the state and the health of the European startup market, this is for you.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a look at exit volumes and what we can infer for 2022, how talent issues aren\u2019t landing equally around the continent, why there\u2019s good and bad news for gender diversity in Europe, how pension fund money is still on the sidelines, and which collections of former employees are founding the most companies.\n\nSounds good? Let\u2019s rock.\n\nEuropean technology M&A is having a good year. The Atomico/Dealroom report details that the total value of tech M&A in Europe through the third quarter of 2021 has crossed the $100 billion mark. For reference, that figure was below $10 billion in Q2 2019, Q3 2019, Q4 2019 and Q2 2020.\n\nBut not every tech exit fits into the venture capital model. Venture-backed exits for European tech companies are a smaller figure, but one that is still rising. Per the same data set, in the first three quarters of 2021, VC-backed tech M&A worked out to $54.9 billion. That\u2019s a hair more than the full-year 2020 number of $54.8 billion. Throw in Q4\u2019s numbers, and not only will 2021 be a record year for VC tech exits \u2013 this data doesn\u2019t include IPOs, mind \u2013 it will be one by a comfortable margin.\n\nBut all that\u2019s the past. We care more about the future. And that\u2019s where the data set pushed our eyebrows higher. Atomico wrote the following:\n\nIf those numbers hold up, we could see roughly 50% of the 2020 total European M&A in Q4 2021 alone. That, and incremental gains from quarter to quarter, implies that Europe is starting 2022 on its strongest non-IPO exit footing in history. Bullish!\n\nRemember Brexit? If you don\u2019t live in the U.K., the political and economic decoupling of the island from the continent may have receded into the back of your mind. It\u2019s an SEP to some degree: someone else\u2019s problem. But while we may think about it a bit less, U.K.-based startups have not forgotten.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/5-things-you-may-have-missed-in-atomicos-2021-europe-report/"},
{"title": "Spain moves closer to passing a startup law", "author": "Natasha Lomas", "published_at": "2021-12-10 08:41:05", "content": "Spain\u2019s government has agreed on the details of a draft startup law \u2014 passing the baton to the parliament to debate and potentially amend the plan ahead of a vote to turn it into actual law.\n\nThe Council of Ministers announced adoption of the draft text today which it said contains important measures to cut red tape and remove bureaucratic obstacles for founding and investing in startups in Spain.\n\nThe package also targets reforms at stock options and access to visas in a bid to make the country a more attractive place for entrepreneurs and digital talent.\n\nIn a press release, Spain\u2019s government said the package of incentives includes what it touted as \u201cthe EU\u2019s most beneficial treatment of returns on stock options\u201d.\n\nMinisters have agreed to raise the tax exemption on stock option income from \u20ac12,000 to \u20ac50,000 per year.\n\nThe draft also stipulates that taxation is delayed until the date of settlement \u2014 either when the stocks are sold or if the company goes public.\n\nOther notable tax measures include a reduction in Corporate Tax and Non-Resident Income Tax (which drops from 25% to 15%) for four years \u2014 which aims to tackle a major barrier, given startups typically aren\u2019t focused on booking revenue in their early years (yet, under the current rules, are expected to pay the same rate of tax as more established businesses).\n\nThe maximum deductible amount for investments in new or recently created companies is also raised (from \u20ac60,000 to \u20ac100,000 per year), while the deduction rate goes from 30% to 50% and the period for considering a company \u201crecently created\u201d is extended, per the draft adopted by ministers.\n\nThe reform also looks set to tackle another key complaint of local founders: The cost and bureaucracy of setting up a startup in Spain \u2014 which has led some founders to establish their business elsewhere in Europe even if they subsequently build their product out of offices in the country.\n\nUnder the draft law, ministers say the procedures for setting up a company will be \u201cstreamlined\u201d into a single step and can be completed online without needing to pay a notary or registry expenses.\n\nStartups will also be able to use an online portal to make business declarations and access benefits, per the release.\n\nOlivier Plante, co-founder of a local keyboard startup, ThingThing \u2014 which develops Fleksy (a keyboard SDK business) out of offices in Spain \u2014 said he felt forced to incorporate his startup in the U.K. back in 2015 \u2014 because of relative costs.\n\n\u201cWe were like three years not making a dime,\u201d he explains. \u201cFirst months we needed a lot of money to get started, registry, stocks, banks, notary (they are parasites tbh)\u2026etc. That\u2019s why we founded the company in the U.K. \u2014 it costs us 70 GBP instead of ~5K EUR in Spain.\u201d\n\nPlante welcomed the reform package \u2014 saying that for him the two most important components are simplifying set-up for startups and the reduction in corporate tax rates in the early years.\n\nThe current approach is essentially \u201ckilling entrepreneurial spirit from day 1\u201d, per Plante, or else limiting the pool of possible founders to those who are in a position to save enough money to get going. \u201cOften, the real entrepreneurs have less means,\u201d he noted, adding: \u201cAnd Spain doesn\u2019t enable the poor to become rich at the source.\u201d\n\nA local startup association, startups asociaci\u00f3n espa\u00f1a, also welcomed the adoption of the draft text by the Council of Ministers \u2014 although it said it\u2019s still waiting to see all the details of the full text once that\u2019s published.\n\nIt also said it\u2019s hoping the parliament will go even further in improving the proposal \u2014 suggesting it should further increase the number of years for a business to be deemed a startup; and \u2014 potentially (assuming the draft has not done so) \u2014 make changes to limiting requirements (such as a startup needing to have 60% of staff in Spain to qualify; or revenue of (only) up to \u20ac5 million).\n\nThe association was most fulsome in its praise of the planned boost to tax deduction for startup investors \u2014 dubbing that\u00a0\u201cexcellent news that puts us on an equal footing with others successful ecosystems\u201d.\n\nThe reform package contains a number of other measures to incentivize entrepreneurialism \u2014 such as entrepreneurs who are simultaneously working as employees at another job no longer being required to contribute twice to the Social Security system (which disincentives bootstrapping); and plans for establishing sandboxes or trial licences in regulated sectors to foster the development of novel services and MVPs.\n\nAlthough it remains to be seen how the parliament may amend specific details.\n\nIn terms of time frame, a government source told TechCrunch it believes the law will be approved in the first half of 2022 \u2014 however, they noted that the deadline allows until the end of the year.\n\nOn the funding front, Spain\u2019s government has an investment target of up to \u20ac4 billion to direct toward fostering startup growth \u2014 including drawing on European Union coronavirus recovery funding.\n\nFor a deep dive on the country\u2019s ten-year plan for the startup reform, check out TechCrunch\u2019s interview with Francisco Polo, Spain\u2019s high commissioner overseeing delivery of the entrepreneurial strategy from earlier this year.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/spain-draft-startup-law/"},

(For more details on the platform see our coverage of its launch.)\n\nPer Wisdom, the platform\u2019s approach is proving popular with podcasters.\n\nOther popular topics at this early stage include mindfulness and social media.\n\nWhile \u2014 on the influencer/mentor side \u2014 it names the likes of musician Kenny G, Buffy the Vampire Slayer actor \u201cSpike\u201d James Marsters and baseball Hall of Famer Andre Dawson as among its early contributors.\n\nCommenting on the seed raise in a statement, First Round Capital said: \u201cWe believe social audio is in its infancy, and it has been great to join Dayo [Akinrinade, Wisdom\u2019s founder and CEO] and witness firsthand her vision for Wisdom. Wisdom taps into some important trends, from social audio to algorithm-friendly design \u2014 all while reflecting just how powerful and impactful communities that feature a range of voices can be \u2014 helping to give diverse and overlooked people access to high quality mentorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far, only the \u2018cocktail-party format\u2019 of Clubhouse has gained widespread traction, but we think ultimately that format will be one of a number of interesting social audio formats,\u201d the VC firm added. \u201cWisdom\u2019s format with intimate 1:1 conversations broadcast to many listeners and its timer to keep the conversation moving make it stand out within the social audio category. It\u2019s great to be able to announce our investment in Social Audio Inc. and its Wisdom app, and we\u2019re looking forward to seeing just how far this app with its unique format and its laudable mission will go.\u201d\n\nAkinrinade attributed \u201cearly success\u201d to \u201cour incredible, helpful community of mentors\u201d, adding in a statement: \u201cThe funding and expertise of our new investors will enable us to nurture and grow this extraordinary community.\u201d\n\nThe startup said the seed funding will be used to build out a roadmap of features \u2014 including features focused on boosting community engagement.\n\nIt also has an Android app in the works (slated for early 2022) and said its to-do list includes launching direct messages; enhancing its AI algorithms doing search and discovery; and building monetization for mentors.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/wisdom-seed/"},
{"title": "Better.com CEO Vishal Garg steps back as employees detail how he \u2018led by fear\u2019", "author": "Mary Ann Azevedo", "published_at": "2021-12-10 08:26:41", "content": "Looks like Better.com CEO Vishal Garg\u2019s behavior is catching up to him.\n\nThis morning, employees were notified via email by the Better board of directors that Garg would be taking time off effective immediately after the \u201cvery regrettable events over the last week.\u201d\n\nThe move came, according to an employee who wished not to be named, after the digital mortgage company hired a crisis firm earlier this week. For those of us following the drama over the past week \u2014 over the past year, really \u2014 it was not a surprise.\n\nMore details around the executive\u2019s behavior have emerged, including in emails that surfaced this week in which Garg berated his own investors, Vice reported. He already had a reputation for using abusive language in emails to employees, but the treatment toward his investors was yet another shock.\n\nIn the email to employees sent this morning, the board said that during the interim period, CFO Kevin Ryan would be assuming the responsibilities of CEO. It also acknowledged that it had engaged \u201can independent 3rd party firm to do a leadership and cultural assessment,\u201d the results of which would be \u201ctaken into account to build a long-term sustainable and positive culture at Better.\u201d\n\nBut the decision may be too little, too late. TechCrunch has spoken with multiple current and former employees who remain skeptical that a toxic culture can be reversed that quickly. Those same employees shared that the CEO\u2019s so-called \u201capology\u201d \u2014 which came after the resignations of the company\u2019s heads of PR, marketing and communications \u2014 was widely viewed as insincere damage control.\n\nOne employee said she had been thinking of resigning even before the recent events, but they finally pushed her over the edge.\n\nGarg \u201cleads by fear,\u201d she said, preferring not to be named. \u201cNothing is ever good enough. He would threaten employees to work harder, faster and not be lazy, but there was never clarity on what the consequences might be.\u201d\n\nThe pressure seemingly intensified over the past few months as the company took a hit when the number of refinancings declined.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a shock that the market had turned on us,\u201d the employee said. \u201cBut the model\u2019s predictions were that it wouldn\u2019t happen this quickly. There just seemed to be more underlying anxiety after the SoftBank investment over the summer and with the SPAC approaching. But they could have been more transparent and just admit they overhired people last year.\u201d\n\nThe company laid off 9% of its staff last week, one day after receiving a $750 million cash infusion as part of an amended SPAC agreement. While it was not the first (or likely the last) company to lay off workers via Zoom in this pandemic era, the way it was handled seemed to offend even casual observers.\n\nAnother sign of panic was that the company, after declaring itself remote-first, was suddenly asking people to return in-person. This was confusing to many, including those who had already moved and bought houses in other cities.\u00a0\n\nIn mid-November, HousingWire reported on preliminary results published by Better\u2019s SPAC partner, Aurora Acquisition Corp., revealing that the digital lender expected a net loss between $85 million and $100 million in the third quarter. And the forecast looked even worse for the fourth quarter, according to an S-4 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nThis is after a year in which Garg received a $25 million cash bonus: \u201cIn 2020, after previously requesting an equity-based award, our CEO was paid a one-time discretionary bonus of $25.0 million as determined by the Board based on his 2020 performance,\u201d the S4 filing said.\n\nMeanwhile, one former employee said her colleagues that stayed on were being asked to take pay cuts and not receiving bonuses. She added that during the pandemic, despite being remote, customer-facing employees were forced to clock in breaks at exactly 15 minutes and 30 minutes.\n\n\u201cIf we went over by even one minute, we\u2019d be talked down to by managers,\u201d she told TechCrunch. \u201cSome team members even had talkings-to by senior managers on this matter.\u201d\n\nThe same employee also scoffed at the notion that Better lived up to its image of being a fintech where opportunities to grow were plentiful.\n\n\u201cBetter advertised itself as a powerful fintech startup where all who wanted to grow within the ecosystem, could. This was untrue,\u201d she said. \u201cThere were virtually no opportunities for growth, raise, department collaboration, etc. Managers were sales machines and regardless of career paths, there was no room to succeed. \u2026 At Better, we were essentially taught to push customers/callers for rate locks, regardless of their intention.\u201d\n\nBetter did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/better-com-ceo-vishal-garg-steps-back-as-employees-detail-how-he-led-by-fear/"},
{"title": "It\u2019s time for tech to embrace security by design", "author": "Mark Sullivan", "published_at": "2021-12-10 08:45:58", "content": "Cybercriminals are getting more and more adept at exploiting the latest trend or issue of high public interest to spread malware and steal personal data from unsuspecting users.\n\nWhether it\u2019s an app related to your favorite TV show, government health updates about COVID or tracking missed package deliveries, the result is too often the same: infected devices leading to fraud or outright theft.\n\nBasic cybersecurity hygiene is the key to protecting your devices against the most common types of malware, but we also need security built into technology to prevent these sophisticated cyberattacks.\n\nThe Secret Service is certainly best known for protecting the president. But its other primary mission is to safeguard the nation\u2019s financial infrastructure and payment systems to preserve the integrity of the economy from a wide range of financial and electronic crimes, including U.S. counterfeit currency, bank and financial institution fraud, illicit financing operations, identity theft, access device fraud and cybercrimes.\n\nWith the prevalence of mobile devices in today\u2019s world, that means that, as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recommends, \u201cusers should avoid \u2014 and enterprises should prohibit on their devices \u2014 sideloading of apps and the use of unauthorized app stores.\u201d\n\nThe pandemic has been a boon to cybercriminals, taking \u201cadvantage of an opportunity to profit from our dependence on technology to go on an internet crime spree,\u201d said Paul Abbate, deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center registered 791,790 complaints in 2020, nearly double the previous year\u2019s total and the largest year-over-year increase ever recorded. One particularly insidious example was text messages that encouraged users to download an app to make vaccine appointments but then sent malware to every device in that user\u2019s contacts that could steal personal data or banking information.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.K.\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) alerted the public to a new form of malware that induced a user to click on a link to track a supposedly missed package delivery, a common occurrence during the pandemic. The link downloaded a malware app, called FluBot, which could then compromise a user\u2019s bank and other financial account details. Cybersecurity researchers discovered \u201cthe volume of malicious [FluBot] SMS messages can number in the tens of thousands per hour.\u201d Hackers are even capitalizing on the popularity of the hit television show \u201cSquid Game\u201d with a new wave of cybercrimes targeting mobile devices using malware hidden in apps related to the show.\n\nMobile devices are now the primary access point for the internet, with 61% of all website visits in the United States in 2020 coming on mobile devices, cementing the trend that only became the majority in 2019. This is reflected in the increased targeting of mobile devices with cyberattacks, with complaints of phishing and smishing attacks \u2014 emails or SMS text messages with malicious links \u2014 to the FBI more than doubling in 2020, rising from 114,702 in 2019 to 241,342 last year.\n\nAs we enter the holiday shopping season, during which one survey indicates that more than 55% of shoppers will make at least one purchase with a mobile device, it is essential that device owners take precautions to protect themselves from attacks.\n\nThe NCSC recommends that users follow basic protections, like frequently backing up their devices, using virus detection software and only installing \u201cnew apps onto your device from the app store your manufacturer recommends.\u201d That guidance mirrors that from the DHS, which also included recommendations that operating systems, apps and other software should be updated regularly and that users and enterprises adopt multifactor authentication.\n\nSimple cyber hygiene recommendations form a layered defense against attacks, dramatically reducing the threat of unauthorized access to mobile devices. Yet as critical and effective as these user actions are, cybercriminals utilize sophisticated techniques that exploit human psychology and behaviors to deceive users and penetrate devices.\n\nThese kinds of attacks, called social engineering attacks, utilize human interactions and social skills to trick users into allowing attackers access to their devices or systems, sometimes even getting users to disable optional security protections. Attacks like FluBot, fake vaccination sites and malicious \u201cSquid Game\u201d apps are all examples of social engineering.\n\nAccording to DHS\u2019 Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, mobile device owners may be more vulnerable to social engineering attacks through text messages because mobile devices\u2019 \u201cintegration of email, voice, text messages and web browser functionality increases the likelihood that users will fall victim to engineered malicious activity.\u201d\n\nThe White House\u2019s Cybersecurity Summit earlier this year identified ways beyond cyber hygiene to protect against unauthorized access: \u201cWe need to transition to where technology is built securely by default. \u2026 We need to know we\u2019re buying secure tech,\u201d a senior White House official said.\n\nSecure-by-design mobile devices would build cyber hygiene protections into the device, removing human psychology from the security equation. Just as seat belts and air bags started as options for car buyers, they are now mandatory safety equipment in all cars.\n\nBasic cyber hygiene protections like multifactor authentication or prohibitions on downloading apps from outside official app stores can be built into systems by design. Mobile devices with these kinds of protections baked in from the start would not be nearly as vulnerable to social engineering attacks even if the device owner was, like most people, interested in a hit television show or worried about a pandemic.\n\nThe public should follow the basic cyber hygiene recommendations of our cybersecurity agencies. But we also need to short-circuit sophisticated social engineering attacks and build high-security protections into the design of our technology.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/its-time-for-tech-to-embrace-security-by-design/"},

Orders made during that period rose by 39 percentage points to reach 4.3 million as the number of Jumia merchants also increased by 11 percentage points to 46,000. Jumia also recorded 40 million unique visitors, a 27 percentage points increase over that period.\n\nAs reported recently, the most popular products on the site were consumables, followed by beauty and fashion items. This comes after the e-commerce platform launched more dark stores to expand its grocery category \u2014 which as per the Q3 results seem to be paying off, yet profitability for the NYSE-listed firm remains elusive.\n\n\u201cOur consumers are increasingly turning to Jumia for their everyday needs with the top three fastest growing physical goods categories in volume terms being fast moving consumer goods (\u2018FMCG\u2019), followed by beauty and fashion,\u201d said Jumia on the SEC filing.\n\nIn a past interview with TechCrunch, Jumia attributed the shift in shopping habits to the stay-at-home restrictions that fueled the need for online shopping as well as the youthful population that is quick to adopt new trends and the increasing smartphone and internet penetration across the continent. Smartphones contribute the most (75%) traffic to the e-commerce site, meaning that as more people get connected, online shoppers are set to increase. Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya account for most of the online sales on Jumia.\n\nPackages handled by Jumia Logistics, its delivery business over the Black Friday season, reached 5.3 million, which Jumia said was \u201cmore than double the average monthly package volume in the first 10 months of 2021.\u201d\n\nJumia is currently the biggest e-commerce platform in Africa, leading hundreds of others, including Nigeria\u2019s Marketplace Africa and South Africa\u2019s Souq, and bidorbuy. The e-commerce platform is available in 11 markets across Africa, including Algeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uganda and Morocco.

{"title": "From Ph.D. to boutique software developer: An interview with Solwey\u2019s Andrew Drach", "author": "Anna Heim", "published_at": "2021-12-10 13:24:11", "content": "Software consultant Andrew Drach\u2019s two companies Callentis and Solwey demonstrate his entrepreneurial skills, but his clients also value his educational background, as we learned through TechCrunch\u2019s survey to identify the best software consultants for startups.\n\nTelling us why her company picked Solwey, eDiscovery Assistant\u2019s Kelly Twigger cited \u201cAndrew\u2019s Ph.D. and analytical background related to data,\u201d as well as the consulting expertise for startups that he provides.\n\nExpertise is only useful when it\u2019s implemented, though \u2014 and Solwey does this too, Twigger said. \u201cWe don\u2019t just add tasks to a Trello board for them to complete, we discuss the goals, why and how best to achieve them with cost/benefit analysis in mind.\u201d This point was seconded by other survey respondents, so we reached out to Drach and his team to learn more.\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nCan you tell us a bit about your recent background and current companies?\n\nAndrew Drach: I have been doing consulting in engineering and software on and off pretty much ever since I started coding. And after a few years working in academia, I realized that I did not want to go the tenure-track faculty route. I told my wife [Monika Jociunaite] that as much as I was passionate about science, I had decided to leave academia and grow freelance consulting into an agency and that she should join me.\n\nMonika was a perfect co-founder with complementary experience and skill set. Her background includes two master\u2019s degrees \u2014 in international business and marketing \u2014 and she spent 5+ years working in large international corporations. She was curious to explore a more creative side of marketing as she enjoyed working on UX/UI projects in the past; and I knew firsthand that for the end users, high-quality code without good UX/UI is no different from broken code.\n\nIn December of 2016, Monika and I established two sister companies: Solwey Consulting, focused on technology strategy and execution, UX/UI design and business intelligence; and Callentis Consulting Group, a research and development business focused on translational research and technology transfer from academia to industry practice.\n\nMore specifically, Solwey provides consulting in all stages of software design and development strategy and execution. We work with our clients on architecture and infrastructure design, optimization of UX/UI design and user flows, back-end and front-end software development for web and mobile, and business intelligence/data analytics to enable our clients to rapidly grow and move forward.\n\nWhy did you choose the boutique consultancy model?\n\nWe both had strained experiences working with large agencies and staffing agencies and feeling abandoned or not important enough to have the full attention of the managers or project owners. Furthermore, we both had seen firsthand how terrifyingly crippling waterfall and broken agile could be for the progress of a project. So we set out to build Solwey and Callentis as small-by-design agencies. We directly engage with our clients, and Monika and I take personal responsibility for every single deliverable from our team.\n\nHow is your team structured?\n\nWe wanted to build a virtual-first, remote-first agency from day one. While it seemed unconventional in pre-pandemic days, this allowed us to stay as lean as the best startups out there, while drastically improving our hiring prospects. We have been incredibly lucky with the talent that joined our team and to celebrate several of our employees\u2019 fourth anniversary while being just a five-year-old agency.\n\nCurrently, we have eight full-time developers, a DevOps manager and our Chief Operating Officer Nima [Kargah-Ostadi] who has a Ph.D. in engineering with a decade of experience leading engineering and research teams and is a certified Project Management Professional (PMP).\n\nHow have you been finding clients?\n\nWhen we started, I just googled platforms for remote contracts for software developers and registered on a few of them. In a couple of days, we had already got a contract, so we immediately got hooked on the freelancing platforms; Upwork was a primary source of projects because it was so quick to find a contract there. But over time as we grew and increased the rates and team size, Upwork became less of a fit for us. Nowadays, we get referrals from former clients, new contracts from returning clients, quite a few requests from organic and paid search, and listings on B2B platforms like Clutch.\n\nMy focus in 2021 has been on diversifying our source of leads and we have been experimenting with many different approaches. So far, the least successful has been hiring business development reps and trying out cold outreach (emails and LinkedIn) but maybe we were just doing it wrong. On the other side of the spectrum, we have had great success establishing partnerships with VC funds and marketing agencies. Other approaches (social media, paid ads, content marketing, networking) also provided interesting results.\n\nHelp TechCrunch find the best software consultants for startups. \n\nProvide a recommendation in this quick survey and we\u2019ll share the results with everybody.\n\nAre startups your main clients, and what do they require? \n\n60% to 70% of our clients are startups or small companies at various stages. We have helped startups at pre-seed stage to create prototypes and guide their technology development plans. At seed stage, we work with them to develop their minimum viable product (MVP), and in subsequent stages, we get to help them with some of their many newly formed initiatives.\n\nSome of these companies approach us before even having a technology team, some are starting to hire and grow their development team, and some have a fully staffed technology team that is swamped with existing work and cannot take on more initiatives.\n\nWe always strive to help startups hire and complete their technology team, especially if they have an idea that revolves around technology. In fact, I have served as interim chief technology officer (CTO) for three startups.\n\nWhy do you think architecture design advice is important?\n\nEarly-stage clients are typically focused on their MVP and launch schedules. Too often, we need to walk this delicate path of helping them move as fast as possible to beat the competition and impress their investors, while at the same time try to stop them from rushing into architectural or strategy decisions that could come back to bite them hard when it is time to enhance some features, add new functionality, iterate or aggressively scale. Meanwhile, we are doing our best to provide guidance, prevent some common issues and explain why early investments in architecture or formal operational processes would help in the near future.\n\nWe tend to focus our recommendations on the time span of roughly six to 12 months so that we do not get stuck with premature optimization. A custom-tailored architectural design allows for a more efficient development process, fast iteration and gets to the robust and scalable software solution leaner and with fewer bumps along the way.\n\nWhat is your billing model? \n\nMonika and I strongly believe that transparency and easy-to-understand billing have helped us a lot in building trust and strong relationships with our clients. We use a project-based billing model with a flat hourly rate.\n\nDuring the preliminary diagnostic conversations with our prospective clients, we try to understand their priorities and carve out a reasonable scope for projects divided into stepwise phases. Nima and I then put together a Gantt chart to visualize a realistic schedule of tasks and estimate the number of hours it would take to design, develop, test and deploy the anticipated solution given client and resource conditions. The proposed budget is simply this number of hours multiplied by our hourly flat rate, which includes all overhead costs.\n\nWhat\u2019s your typical timeline?\n\nFor a typical startup product that is at initial phases of developing an MVP, we typically recommend two weeks for discovery and requirements gathering, four weeks for UX/UI design along with infrastructure and architecture design, eight weeks for agile development and continuous testing to implement the major functionality and finally two weeks for deploying the MVP solution and last-minute tweaks.\n\nWe work with our clients to postpone any tasks that were collectively identified as non-blocking or non-critical to keep the MVP lean enough to have a successful launch within such a short timeline. This is because in our experience, four months is long enough time to develop most MVPs and short enough to enable rapid launch and get much needed feedback from users and investors that guarantee the success of the startup in subsequent phases.\n\nTwo of your clients mentioned coming to you after not-so-great experiences with other firms. Could you explain what this is like? And do you have any advice for startups wanting to avoid bad experiences?\n\nThe very first thing I tell our clients in the diagnostics call, is that sometimes things do not work out, but their negative experience does not mean that working with external teams is always going to fail or that their previous technology partner was unqualified or had bad intentions. I joke sometimes that our team should be called \u201citeration #3.\u201d A majority of projects that we take over usually went through two iterations: once with an agency outside of the United States, due to cheaper rates, and another time with a junior or midlevel freelancer. And while there is absolutely nothing wrong with either approach, founders tend to underestimate the level of hands-on coordination required to complete the project in those scenarios.\n\nAdvice on avoiding a bad experience? Setting clear expectations and communication. Whether a startup is engaged with a staff-augmentation agency, or a temporary hire, or a freelancer, or an agency like us, it all boils down to having clear delineation of tasks and frequent check-ins to ensure that any potential issues surface quickly and the team can pivot quickly. Will there be unexpected issues, delays, complications? Certainly. But it matters how these obstacles are communicated and addressed.\n\nDo you have any thoughts on fake agile versus real agile? And why do you believe in the latter?\n\nIn my opinion, the word \u201cagile\u201d has been loosely applied to many different approaches and strategies to manage projects so the discussion of \u201cfake\u201d versus \u201creal\u201d agile is tricky without a specific context or example. Through our interactions with different teams, we have encountered cases when the agile process ended up being extremely inefficient for a number of reasons. Sometimes, a manager or team lead would be laser-focused on agile ceremonies designed for large distributed teams while the total team size is just two developers working in the same room. In other cases, the process was set to be so fluid that the priorities would shift several times a day. And sometimes, the team would define weekly or biweekly sprints, but then would have a rigid quarterly plan that looks exactly like a waterfall approach.\n\nTo be honest, I am not sure that our process would fall into the strict definition of agile because we adjust it and try to accommodate client preferences to reduce any potential friction. We have several important requirements, including daily check-ins with our designers and developers, weekly sprints with well-defined tasks, regular release schedules, continuous integration flows, striving to have design assets be ready 1-2 sprints ahead of development, etc. But beyond those, we do our best to accommodate and provide recommendations to the client as the process would be quite different for a one-person team versus a late-stage startup with dozens of team members spread across multiple time zones.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/from-ph-d-to-boutique-software-developer-an-interview-with-solweys-andrew-drach/"},
{"title": "As EU\u2019s VAT reform ramps up, marketplaces must focus on compliance to avoid tax risk", "author": "Roger Gothmann", "published_at": "2021-12-10 12:12:17", "content": "Electronic interfaces, platforms and marketplaces form a key layer in the digital infrastructure behind e-commerce, serving as gatekeepers between consumers and producers of digital content or digitally sold products.\n\nThese gatekeepers offer third-party companies access to a global market by providing their own infrastructure. It is therefore not surprising that their growth is often driven by a strong influx of third-party companies, which can expand internationally with their products and content without having to build their own technological infrastructure.\n\nAn increasing number of online retailers use such platforms for their e-commerce businesses, which has made these platforms an integral part of compliance procedures.\n\nOn July 1, 2021 there was a big change in the European Union\u2019s Value Added Tax (VAT) law, impacting online retailers, marketplaces and their e-commerce businesses across the EU. Since 1993, the VAT law in the European Union concerning cross-border e-commerce was in large part unchanged and was originally introduced for mail order businesses that used catalogues.\n\nBut EU member states realized a few years ago that EU VAT law was no longer on track with the developments taking place in the e-commerce ecosystem.\n\nThis has led to many problems for marketplaces like Amazon, as they have a significant number of third-party merchants based outside the EU. For example, third-party merchants account for about 50%-60% of Amazon Germany\u2019s revenue, and more than half of these merchants based in China.\n\nThe VAT problems that arise from this led to enormous tax losses in the past, because third-party merchants, especially those from China, did not declare the VAT that was actually due in the EU, giving them a huge market advantage over the EU merchants. The EU has recognized this and initiated the VAT reform, which primarily places responsibility on the marketplaces.\n\nThe EU VAT e-commerce package, under specific circumstances, can make online sellers and marketplaces liable to pay VAT and leads to certain challenges and risks.\n\nSince July, it has been key for marketplaces to determine the VAT due for every transaction and establish related processes such as VAT rate determination, invoicing, filing and reporting. This is applicable to marketplaces when they are liable to pay tax on transactions by sellers not based in the EU or for distance sales from non-EU countries.\n\nMarketplaces have to be aware of additional indirect tax regulations to avoid massive tax and financial risks. Not adapting to the new regulations can result in paying VAT and interest retrospectively for the sales made on the platform. In Germany, this would mean paying 19% VAT on the net sales, with fines and interest added on top. In countries like Italy, the surcharges can reach up to 240%.\n\nIt is not only necessary for online merchants to determine the VAT rate for their products, but marketplace operators, being liable for VAT under certain circumstances, also have to ensure the application of the correct VAT rate in every EU member state.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/as-eus-vat-reform-ramps-up-marketplaces-must-focus-on-compliance-to-avoid-tax-risk/"},

This, she claims, led to her \u201carbitrary arrest by the UAE\u2019s security services and rendition to Saudi Arabia, where she was detained, imprisoned and tortured.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit alleges Gerike, Baier and Adams purchased malicious code from a U.S. company and intentionally directed the code to Apple servers in the U.S. to reach and place malicious software on al-Hathloul\u2019s iPhone in violation the CFAA. It also alleges that they aided and abetted in crimes against humanity due to the fact the hacking of al-Hathloul\u2019s phone was part of the UAE\u2019s widespread and systematic attack against human rights defenders and activists.\n\nThe EFF, which filed the lawsuit alongside law firms Foley Hoag LLP and Boise Matthews LLP, says this is a \u201cclear-cut\u201d case of device hacking, whereby \u201cDarkMatter operatives broke into al-Hathloul\u2019s iPhone without her knowledge to insert malware, with horrific consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cProject Raven went beyond even the behaviour that we have seen from NSO Group, which has been caught repeatedly having sold software to authoritarian governments who use their tools to spy on journalists, activists and dissidents,\u201d said Eva Galperin, cybersecurity director at EFF. \u201cDarkMatter didn\u2019t merely provide the tools; they oversaw the surveillance program themselves.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, al-Hathloul said:", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/eff-sues-spyware-maker-darkmatter-for-illegally-hacking-saudi-activist/"},
{"title": "The \u2018art\u2019 of VC startup valuations is a forgery", "author": "Scott Lenet", "published_at": "2021-12-10 13:51:01", "content": "Venture capitalists frequently say that valuing startups is \u201cmore art than science.\u201d If that\u2019s true, then it\u2019s absurdist art, because most seed-stage businesses have no value.\n\nIn fact, seed-stage startups \u2014 companies that have not yet released a product, regardless of how many rounds they\u2019ve raised \u2014 are probably worth less than zero using any rational valuation methodology. The only certainty at this stage is that the startup will keep losing more money until a product is released, at which point it\u2019s possible that revenue may be generated. The chances of going out of business are high.\n\nIt\u2019s not that much better for early-stage startups, which again, are not defined by rounds like Series A or Series B, but by how much business progress they\u2019ve made. Once a seed-stage company has released a working product, the startup has reduced one of the two major risks facing the business: commercialization. At this stage, now a company must prove the new product or service can be turned into a scalable business.\n\nLike seed-stage startups, early-stage companies are still very fragile, with little predictability of revenue or cash flows. By definition, once the business has become predictable, the company is in the growth or expansion stage. Without predictability, traditional valuation tools like discounted cash flow (DCF) are nearly useless.\n\nSo venture capitalists lie to entrepreneurs and pretend that seed- and early-stage startups have intrinsic value.\n\nWhy would investors agree to ascribe value to assets that have no objective current economic value?\n\nI\u2019ve heard many corporate executives ask this exact question, wondering whether it wouldn\u2019t be better simply to acquire startups instead of funding them, usually in hopes that rational valuation techniques can be applied.\n\nThe best answer, based on my experience as a venture capitalist and entrepreneur for three decades, has nothing to do with valuation methodology and everything to do with teamwork, belief and commitment. Investors must be on the same team as the entrepreneurs they fund. And this means that each party needs an opportunity to win and must demonstrate that they believe in common goals. In venture capital, where investors rely on high growth rates, a \u201cwin-win\u201d compensation design is much more important than a \u201ctechnically correct\u201d valuation.\n\nAt the seed stage, where the value is arguably zero, investors would own all of the startup with an investment of any amount. Obviously, no entrepreneur would willingly accept such an arrangement.\n\nThus, to be fair to the entrepreneur, the lie is born. We pretend the startup has value so that the startup\u2019s team is motivated and everyone involved has a chance to win. The VC also won\u2019t take a majority of the startup in most cases, because a control position means the entrepreneur is \u201cworking for\u201d the investors. The philosophy of venture capital is that the entrepreneur runs the business and the investor provides capital and support in exchange for a minority share and a non-operational role.\n\nI learned this from Bill Draper, who was one of the first venture capitalists on the West Coast in the 1960s. He said that in those early days, the goal was just to keep it simple, in contrast to the \u201cfinancial engineering\u201d that typified growth-stage investing on the East Coast.\n\nHis mantra back then was \u201chalf for the entrepreneur and half for the investors.\u201d When investors realized that employees need motivation too, this became a third for the entrepreneur, a third for the investors and a third for employees. It\u2019s not dramatically different today.\n\nSo if this is true, is there any role for valuation discipline at the seed or early stage?\n\nThe answer is yes, because the investor still needs to evaluate the deal as a potential source of return against other alternative investment opportunities, so long as the resulting valuation is fair to the entrepreneurs.\n\nIn fact, a good analogy for how this works may come from real estate. Prior to becoming a venture capitalist in 1992, I worked as a real estate appraiser. Appraisers use three main methodologies when valuing a property: intrinsic value, income-producing value and market value.\n\nIntrinsic value is often called \u201creplacement cost\u201d in real estate. It\u2019s what it would cost to buy a similar parcel of land and rebuild the same house from scratch, estimating the cost of labor and materials. In real estate appraising, this method carries almost no weight, just as in venture capital.\n\nThe income method in real estate applies to properties that produce predictable cash flow, like apartment buildings or established rental properties. For obvious reasons, this method is impossible to apply to seed- and early-stage startups where there is no profit and nothing is predictable except for expenses. This is why DCF isn\u2019t used to value startups.\n\nThe dominant valuation technique used in real estate appraisals is the third methodology, market value. This approach seeks to understand how the market values similar assets, as defined by location, style, square footage and transaction recency. In other words, what have other buyers demonstrated they will pay for similar houses in the same neighborhood during the last six months?\n\nReal estate appraisers use comparable sales to determine an adjusted price per square foot as the principal basis for calculating valuations when applying the market value method.\n\nVenture capitalists do something very similar. There are clear valuation ranges for startups by stage and by round, which represent an established market value. These figures are even published by PitchBook, CB Insights and other organizations that track startup investment activity.\n\nVCs then look for comparable sales in the exit values of startups with similar business models in the same industry, measuring price-to-revenue for M&A and IPOs. We then apply these multiples to projections of future revenues to determine if we can achieve a \u201crisk-adjusted\u201d multiple at today\u2019s market price.\n\nFor a venture capitalist, it doesn\u2019t matter if a startup has an intrinsic value of zero today if there\u2019s a reasonable chance to make 10x our money or better. It\u2019s the potential multiple that matters, not whether we can apply traditional finance metrics to a startup.\n\nThis is completely different than how valuations are typically calculated when making an acquisition, creating potential confusion for corporate development personnel who\u2019ve added venture capital investing as a new responsibility.\n\nWhen a corporation makes acquisitions, each transaction must make independent financial sense. Venture capitalists, however, can accept the risk of seed- and early-stage startups \u2014 including a rational expectation of experiencing some failures \u2014 by taking a portfolio approach. VC investors don\u2019t require a fixed or predictable return but seek a blended return on a pool of capital that is invested in multiple startups. According to PitchBook, the average VC fund has 18.4 portfolio companies and top-quartile performance has generally corresponded to returning approximately 2x aggregate committed capital over the last few decades.\n\nAll that\u2019s required to justify a seed- or early-stage investment is to believe that the potential multiple on investment offsets the risk that capital may not be returned. This is based on the premise that the most VCs can lose is 1x their money \u2014 and the most they can make is unlimited. Of course, investors need to be rational about whether the potential multiple is realistic and worth the risk, investor Fred Wilson noted.\n\nAnd this means venture capitalists are free to participate in the fiction about what seed- and early-stage startups are worth today. The real purpose of valuations at this stage is to find a split that is fair and motivational for everyone involved.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/the-art-of-vc-startup-valuations-is-a-forgery/"},
{"title": "1,000 companies per Y Combinator batch? RIP Y Combinator", "author": "Haje Jan Kamps", "published_at": "2021-12-10 12:33:24", "content": "Don\u2019t worry, Y Combinator fans, you\u2019ll be able to write off this entire opinion piece as the disgruntled musings of \u201ca failed startup founder who was never able to get into Y Combinator,\u201d because seen through one lens, that\u2019s exactly what I am. But, damn it, for a while there, being a Y Combinator company meant something. People who\u2019d gone through Y Combinator spoke through it in hushed tones, as if God\u2019s own light had shined upon them, and they had been touched by the wings of an angel.\n\nTruth is, for a lot of companies, being part of Y Combinator was a huge breakthrough, and getting the YC stamp of approval meant something. The selection criteria were stringent, and whenever there was a YC demo day, the entire startup ecosystem would be wafting themselves with a sense of arousal and excitement. The press would be sharpening its proverbial pencils, and investors would be clamoring for the most promising startups. Both groups did that for the same reason: To make it through the YC selection process and survive it through the end of the program meant that the companies at least reached a basic level of competence.\u00a0\n\nPeople who don\u2019t know much about martial arts think that earning a black belt is a big deal. It is \u2014 but in most systems, it shows just that you have basic proficiency, and that you can be trusted to practice with some level of safety and competency. People who understand martial arts understand that the true deep study starts at the black-belt level. In a way, the same was true for Y Combinator: Get accepted and work your way through the program, and you\u2019ve got your black belt. Congrats, pop some champagne, pat yourself on the back. Now the real work begins.\n\nSo when Y Combinator\u2019s new boss Geoff Ralston says he can see Y Combinator fund 1,000 companies per batch at some point in the none-too-distant future, my read is that the firm is tooling up to change from being a boutique martial arts gym to a mass-market dojo that\u2019s trying to train a ludicrous number of founders into fighting-fit karate kids. Although, if you remember \u201cKarate Kid,\u201d the smaller, scrappier gym was, ultimately, a better place to be.\n\nThe move would make a lot of sense for Y Combinator \u2014 if, as Ralston claims, they will be able to keep the quality of founders and the selection criteria at a high level, the firm is effectively creating an index fund of startups. At the stage Y Combinator invests, they can pick up a not-insignificant percentage of the companies for not a lot of money. If 1\u2030 (that\u2019s 1 out of a thousand) startups turn into an Airbnb, DoorDash, Coinbase, GitLab, Dropbox, Amplitude, Matterport, PagerDuty, Stripe, Instacart, Cruise, Brex, Reddit, Zapier, Gusto, Flexport, Monzo, Mux or Rippling, it\u2019s a hell of a business model. That impressive list of startups isn\u2019t a coincidence; those are all companies you\u2019ve probably heard of, and all Y Combinator portfolio companies.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t for the investors; they\u2019re going to be just fine. The challenge is for the startups. Some will argue that network effects get better when the network gets bigger; and that might be true \u2014 but that is an incredibly hard problem to solve. Not least because the very best founders don\u2019t have time to actually participate in the network; especially in the early days, they\u2019re heads down building their startups, not rolling up their sleeves to help other founders.\n\nAs a founder, I\u2019d question whether it\u2019s worthwhile to be a part of a 1,000-strong cohort. Will the Y Combinator badge of honor help you get a meeting with an investor? Will it help you get bumped to the top of a journalist\u2019s email inbox? Or will it simply cease to be valuable as a filter to the outside world, and drastically reduce the value of having been a Y Combinator alum in the first place?\n\nMy personal suspicion is that Y Combinator becoming huge(r) is great for YC and its limited partners (i.e. the people investing into YC). For the startups, there\u2019s a point of diminishing returns. I think that point was a while back when the cohorts ballooned to 377 startups and became completely unwieldy for anyone who was trying to keep an overview of what was happening inside its rapidly expanding walls.\n\nIt\u2019s only a question of time before someone starts offering the service and exclusivity of what YC did in the early days \u2014 there are already a few contenders in the running \u2014 and when one of them starts gaining traction and building up a portfolio of its own, YC would be left with an index fund of the also-rans. I would be delighted to be wrong, but it feels like this is the beginning of the end of the Silicon Valley institution.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/y-combinator/"},

{"title": "How optimizing presales productivity can help startups multiply revenue growth", "author": "Freddy Jose Mangum", "published_at": "2021-12-10 10:36:37", "content": "Today\u2019s high-growth technology companies rely on millions of presales professionals, also known as sales engineers and solution consultants, to explain the value of technologies to buyers and customers. Ultimately, the contributions of these trusted technical advisers help close sales.\n\nBut while the C-suite acknowledges presales as a necessary supporting function to sales, executives don\u2019t look to presales when they want to yield more growth.\n\nInstead, the chief revenue officer (CRO), who typically oversees the presales organization, will often try to brute-force growth by adding more sales reps. That\u2019s one way, but there are other approaches, especially in a market where finding talent has its own challenges.\n\nAn alternative solution may lie in presales. According to a McKinsey & Company survey, investing in presales can improve conversion rates by five points, raise revenue by 6%-13% and accelerate sales by 10%-20%.\n\nRather than adding more headcount, the CRO can try something different \u2014 the presales force multiplier effect \u2014 to boost revenue.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, let\u2019s examine three scenarios to quantify the impact of presales on growth.\n\nRevenue models that have a high volume of transactions with corresponding low annual contract values (ACVs), say $10,000 to $50,000, can commonly have a presales-to-sales ratio of 10:1. If each sales representative has an annual quota of $750,000, this implies that one presales professional can have an annual quota influence of $7.5 million across all 10 sales representatives.\n\nIf a presales professional\u2019s productivity were to increase 5% across the $7.5 million top-line influence, it could result in $375,000 ($7.5 million * 5%) incremental revenue without the need for additional headcount.\n\nEnvision a model where ACVs could range from $51,000 to $100,000 and the presales-to-sales ratio is 5:1. If each sales representative has an annual quota of $900,000, this implies that one presales professional can have an annual quota influence of $4.5 million across all five sales representatives. If one presales professional\u2019s productivity were to increase by 10% across the $4.5 million top-line influence, it could result in $450,000 ($4.5 million * 10%) incremental revenue without adding to the headcount.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/how-optimizing-presales-productivity-can-help-startups-multiply-revenue-growth/"},

That\u2019s 3X our 2021 output.\u201d\n\nFord confirmed to TechCrunch that it will be able to increase production capacity of the Mustang Mach E by building some of the vehicles at its factory in Cuautitlan, Mexico.\n\nThe tweet came the same day that Automotive News reported Ford was delaying the start of production of battery-electric versions of the Explorer and Lincoln Aviator crossovers by about 18 months, according to memos sent to suppliers and viewed by Automotive News. The EV versions of the Explorer and Aviator were supposed to be assembled at its Cuautitlan, Mexico factory.\n\nFord has previously said it expected sales to be around 50,000 Mustang Mach E vehicles for the first year of production (MY 2021) in North America and Europe.

Eugene Bisovka and Razmik Sukyasov co-founded Vancouver-based Tiggy in July 2021, just about the time that Instacart announced it was beginning food delivery in Quebec, giving the food delivery giant access to all 10 Canadian provinces now.\n\nMany individual grocers offered their own delivery during the global pandemic, in addition to the delivery incumbents Instacart, PC Express, Inabuggy, DoorDash and Uber Eats. Tiggy is taking the approach of offering a faster delivery, with no minimum charge or no extra cost, which Bisovka told TechCrunch differentiates the company from its competitors that have longer delivery times and associated fees.\n\n\u201cWhat impressed me was that Canada has a $100 billion market and almost no food delivery players,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was a big reason we chose this market. You can get groceries from DoorDash or Uber Eats, but it takes one hour for delivery and they charge fees, so it is not clear what the final price will be.\u201d\n\nEmploying a dark store model is another differentiator, as the model is one that is \u201cvirtually non-existent in Canada,\u201d Bisovka said. He explained that the dark store approach leads to hundreds of additional orders per day in the $25 to $30 range, with a projected contribution margin between 10% and 12%.\n\nThe company launched its service in September with over 1,400 SKUs, including pantry staples and fresh fruits and vegetables. It is also encouraging more consumer behavior toward on-demand shopping, for example, if you\u2019re cooking and run out of an item or realize you don\u2019t have it.\n\nHeartland led the seed round and was joined by Global Founders Capital, FJ Labs and Redbox Ventures. With the new capital, Bisovka intends to double the amount of SKUs offered, expand Tiggy\u2019s footprint in Vancouver with two new dark stores \u2014 it already has four stores \u2014 and enter Toronto with five stores by the end of the year. It also gives the company a solid runway to open 350 fulfillment centers across the country by 2024.\n\nThough Bisovka declined to discuss growth metrics outside of having now employed 150 people in five months, Turner Novak, founder of Banana Capital, and one of the company\u2019s early investors, said Tiggy was growing \u201cat an impressive pace\u201d and is already disrupting incumbents that have 1 million customers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been impressive watching them over the past couple of months,\u201d Novak added. \u201cWith the dark store model, there is more of an opportunity to stay capital efficient, though harder to launch your own fulfillment.

To find that company, you might have to go through a broker. Then when the truck gets to the border, you have to deal with all this paperwork to actually get an export out of Mexico imported into the U.S.,\u201d Chhugani explained. \u201cYou also have to then hire another company to help you move the trailer from Mexico to the U.S.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s called a transfer carrier for the unacquainted. Then on top of that, the vendor has to go through the same process in the U.S. to find a trucking company to get the product to its final destination.\n\nMidsize companies either have to form logistics departments in-house to deal with all the complexities, different currencies, laws and vendors, or, they hire brokers and freight forwarders to help with pieces of the process.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWith our flagship offering, we go to companies and say, \u2018we can take care of that entire experience for you,\u2019\u201d Chhugani said. \u201cWe have the infrastructure, the transportation network, the compliance and the software to help you move those products end to end. It\u2019s kind of a one-stop shop. In that way, we become an extension of our customers.\u201d\n\nToday, Nuvocargo mainly focuses on the transportation aspect of moving the goods. Down the line, it\u2019s rolling out a series of other products and services.\n\nAlready, the company has revealed the first of a series of financial products it is building \u2014 QuickPay for carriers, which is essentially a cash advance product for the truckers in Nuvocargo\u2019s marketplace.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a small private beta for a couple of months and the adoption has been extremely exciting,\u201d Chhugani said. \u201cQuickPay for carriers has been growing processing volumes by 35% weekly and recently crossed seven figures in annualized transaction volume in just a few short weeks since launch.\u201d\n\nWith an estimated 10 million trucks moving cargo between Mexico and the United States each year, Nuvocargo estimates the market for QuickPay at around $20 billion annually.\n\nSupply chain issues have dominated headlines for some time now, and what Nuvocargo is building has great potential to improve efficiencies along the trade corridor between the U.S. and Latin America, according to Tiger\u2019s John Curtius.\n\nSince it began operations in late 2019, Nuvocargo has been growing its revenues by about 30% month over month. While he declined to reveal hard revenue figures, Chhugani expects Nuvocargo will generate \u201ctens of millions of dollars\u201d in annual revenue in 2022. It\u2019s also on track to close this year with 5x revenue growth compared to 2020. The company has tripled its team since announcing its Series A in April, from 30 to about 90.\n\nAlso participating in the latest round of funding is The Flexport Fund, Kavak COO Federico Ranero and existing backers such as QED Investors, NFX and ALLVP. Prior Nuvocargo investors include Y Combinator, Nubank founder David Velez and the co-founders of several unicorns, including Deel, Rappi, Ramp and Loft, among others. The additional funding brings Nuvocargo\u2019s total raised to date to $37.8 million.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.-Mexico cross-border trade is poised for growth in the coming years with Mexico\u2019s growing manufacturing sector,\u201d said Hursh Narain, partner at The Flexport Fund. \u201cDeepak is an incredible founder that understands the current state and has vision for a digital future state.\u201d\n\nNuvocargo fits the fund\u2019s thesis that customers in global logistics are better served hiring digitally native service providers than they are trying to layer software on top of the old, offline world, added Ben Braverman, chief customer officer at Flexport and partner at The Flexport Fund.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nuvocargo-raises-20-5m-at-a-180m-valuation-to-bolster-trade-between-the-us-and-mexico/"},
{"title": "3 views: The new decentralized venture landscape is changing how we report startup data", "author": "Natasha Mascarenhas", "published_at": "2021-12-10 13:35:47", "content": "Where is Silicon Valley, really?\n\nIn 2021, it\u2019s no longer a Bay Area hub backed by Sand Hill Road investors \u2014 it\u2019s everywhere. The decentralization of capital to emerging ecosystems has done more than empower local entrepreneurs to raise that follow-on round, it\u2019s also changed our work as journalists.\n\nAfter Mary Ann published an exclusive look at how fundraising is moving beyond Silicon Valley, we decided to unpack our views on the trend\u2019s long-term impact. Mary Ann followed up her reporting with a few thoughts about how the rise of startup hubs across America is hardly new and certainly nothing to be afraid of. Natasha and Alex dug into data-focused reporting, a key plank of the startup journalism game that is evolving as the market matures. What can we say, the Equity team can\u2019t stop talking!\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m going to go out on a limb here and say that, in a world of fast-moving deals and the end of HQs, startup geography data has never mattered less.\n\nNow that you\u2019re paying attention, I\u2019m going to slightly hedge that and say that this somewhat controversial mindset doesn\u2019t include emerging markets. For the longest time, startup data helped us understand how an entrepreneurial scene was growing. The concentration of capital in late-stage deals, for example, would show that the winners are winning but perhaps at the cost of smaller upstarts. A thriving angel scene would let us know that pre-seed startups are going to enjoy a boost of activation energy.\n\nBut what happens when the bounds of traditional geography goes away? You can be a startup based in Boston, but where do the concentration of your employees live? Where do your investors live? You may have answers, but maybe they will only be correct for the month.\n\nDigital nomads aside, my point is that distributed work\u2019s popularization clouds a little bit of our classic \u201clocal startup\u201d news coverage. Detroit\u2019s scene may be booming, but thanks to a nod from Miami and a wire from Boston. I think this means that our data needs to focus more on networks than ever before, understanding \u2014 at an aggregate level \u2014 how a startup\u2019s success has a ripple effect across other communities. In other words, Duolingo\u2019s public debut may have benefitted Pittsburgh\u2019s local startup scene, but what if the company\u2019s growth will now only look international?

Silicon Valley may be seeing its status as the The Startup Market being challenged both at home and abroad, but another market is not changing as quickly. Namely the funding landscape for women founding business-focused software companies. Given just how big a chunk of the startup market such businesses comprise, the gender gap is staggering. (A small shoutout to our own Ron Miller for his consistent reporting on inequities in the startup industry is in order, I think.)\n\nIn his latest guest post for TechCrunch+, OpenView partner Kyle Poyar explains why usage-based pricing \u201cis a companywide effort\u201d that \u201crequires ditching the old SaaS metrics playbook.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no fad: UBP went mainstream because SaaS companies that use it see dramatically higher growth and retention rates.\n\nCiting examples from powerhouses like Twilio, Stripe, AWS and others, Poyar explains how UBP companies \u201cshare their customers\u2019 success\u201d and reduce their risk of ending up with a CRM packed \u201cwith lots of unprofitable customers.\u201d\n\n(TechCrunch+ is our membership program, which helps founders and startup teams get ahead.

Happily for startup fans and the venture classes, both IPOs went well. Samsara\u2019s IPO will come next week if current calendars hold up, but that\u2019s pretty much it for the year.\n\nWe made it to the end! But that doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have work to do. We do.\n\nThe Exchange explores startups, markets and money. \n\nRead it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.\n\nThis morning, we\u2019re parsing the final IPO prices of both HashiCorp and Nubank, tabulating their final pre-debut valuations and revenue multiples, and teasing out what we can learn from their early trading. The goal is to get a good handle on how strong the U.S. technology IPO market looks as 2021 ends.\n\nThere should be, provided no major shocks, an active 2022 IPO cycle. Our basis for that perspective is that technology valuations for public companies remain far above historical norms and the backlog of yet-private unicorns is at an all-time high. The combination reads like a recipe for a lot of flotations next year.\n\nBut we need to grok how 2021 ended to understand where 2022 begins.\n\nHashiCorp anticipated that it would price its IPO between $68 and $72 per share. It wound up selling equity in its public debut at $80 per share, a massive win for the open source-focused software company.\n\nRenaissance Capital noted that at $70 per share, HashiCorp was worth $14.2 billion. Simple math pegs the company\u2019s fully diluted valuation with an $80 per-share price at $16.2 billion. Given that the company was last valued at around the $5 billion mark by private-market investors in early 2020, its IPO price was nothing short of revolutionary, though we might argue that it was simply underpriced in 2020, undercutting how staggering its IPO price really was.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/nubank-hashicorp-provide-startup-market-with-end-of-year-ipo-wins/"},

While the company\u2019s moniker is indeed the name of a \u201cStar Wars\u201d character, CEO Prateek said they chose it more for name recognition than a passion for the movies.\n\nPrior to starting the company, the co-founders were already working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and e-commerce at companies like Flipkart and Truefit.\n\nPrateek, in particular, just happened to be trying to solve the pricing problem at Flipkart with a large team optimizing SKUs across geographies and channels. He later left to build other startups, but continued to get inquiries from e-commerce companies for help with pricing. It was when the amount of calls increased that he asked Bala, with whom he was already working, if she wanted to build a business.\n\n\u201cWe had customers even before we started building the company,\u201d Prateek told TechCrunch. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a product to sell them, though, it was just me advising them on how to set it up.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the technology works: Company A prices an item, for example a tomato, and everyone else has to price their tomatoes similarly to entice buyers to buy it from them instead of Company A.\n\nRather than try to guess what the best price will be, Anakin automates the management and pricing of millions of SKUs from competitors using data like inventory to provide those insights in real time so that retailers can increase their revenue, on average, by up to 12%.\n\nAnakin started in the grocery space and has now expanded into food delivery, ridesharing and travel. Though he was not able to disclose customers, Prateek did say the company is working with some of the largest companies in those spaces.\n\nIn fact, prior to securing the seed round, the company was already profitable. It didn\u2019t need to raise the round, but Anakin was running lean with just the two of them and wanted to grow fast in multiple sectors and geographies, he added.\n\nThe company, with a presence in San Francisco, Singapore and India, secured the new capital from Y Combinator, HOF Capital, Austen Allred, ACE & Company, Integrity, Pioneer Fund and a group of angel investors.\n\nSo far, Anakin is growing its revenue 24% every month and is live in more than 10 countries, Prateek said. The funding will be used to hire additional employees to have more boots on the ground in other countries. The company will also invest in product development, expanding into other categories and creating a self-service tool.\n\n\u201cWe started in the middle of COVID, and we were scared that it would shut us down, but even mom-and-pop stores are online and competing with Amazon,\u201d he added.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/anakins-pricing-tool-gives-e-commerce-companies-jump-on-competitors/"},

The feature leverages the Stories Archive, so users can customize and select up to 10 stories to share with their followers. To be eligible for this feature, users need to have posted more than three stories this year or have Stories Archive turned on. The platform will suggest Playback posts for you, but you\u2019ll also have the option to pick what you want to share. Users will see a message in their Instagram feed inviting them to create their own Playback. The new feature will be available to users for several weeks.\n\nIn previous years, Instagram users have created their own version of an end-of-year feature where they would post their top nine images in a photo grid.

Meta notes that these two features are rolling out over the next few days to all users around the globe.\n\nThe launch of the new features comes as shareable end-of-year recaps have become increasingly popular thanks to Spotify\u2019s\u00a0annual Wrapped experience that is widely shared across social media each year.

Now, Horizon Worlds \u2014 the Second Life or Minecraft of Meta\u2019s VR apps \u2014 is expanding out of invite-only beta, opening up to all users over 18 years old in the U.S. and Canada. This is a huge milestone for the app, which was first announced in 2019.\n\nThe free app is a social world-building playground. When you enter the app (after a short tutorial if it\u2019s your first time), you\u2019re presented with three options: play (games), attend (events) and hang out. You can explore experiences that Meta itself created, plus community-generated spaces, which anyone can build. In October, the company announced $10 million in funding for creators building these VR experiences, incentivizing users to make new games and hangouts.\n\nBefore you enter any of these virtual spaces, the platform reminds you that anyone you interact with is a real person.\n\nOn the primary menu, which you access by looking at your left wrist, there\u2019s a safety button that you can press, which instantly sends you to your \u201cSafe Zone,\u201d a private room where you can take a break or block, mute and report people.\n\nOne of the first hangout spaces users might encounter is the Plaza, a space created by Meta. Our legless avatar threw paper airplanes with strangers and even spoke with a community moderator, who chatted with newcomers and helped explain how the controls work (they\u2019re intuitive enough, but take a few minutes to get used to). It was a weirdly pleasant experience, absorbing the futuristic scenery and listening as people around us chatted about their avatars\u2019 outfits, making metaverse small talk.\n\nBut in user-generated spaces, there won\u2019t always be these human moderators who could intervene if something goes wrong. It\u2019s not realistic to expect to see a Meta representative in every space in Horizon Worlds \u2014 it might even feel a bit creepy \u2014 but the metaverse poses new challenges in keeping people safe online.\n\nMeta has struggled to remove hate speech and violent images from Facebook, and the company is reeling from the impact of leaked internal documents that show how its app Instagram can be dangerous for teens\u2019 mental health. Just yesterday, head of Instagram Adam Mosseri testified before Congress about online safety for children and teens. But a metaverse world poses additional challenges, as it\u2019s a more immersive audio-visual experience. Clubhouse struggled to moderate its live audio rooms, and even Twitter has run into issues with harmful content on Spaces as of late. Twitch streamers have dealt with \u201chate raids,\u201d too.\n\nBut in terms of user experience, Horizon Worlds is a massive step up from Horizon Venues, Meta\u2019s platform for immersive events (once Worlds is globally accessible out of beta, Venues might be rendered obsolete).\n\nRight now, if you use Venues, you just get dropped into a blocky entry area, like a hallway in a movie theater. You can choose from a few rooms to enter, where you can watch a pixelated recording of a Billie Eilish concert on loop, for example. Worlds already feels more engaging and promising than Venues. But as Horizon Worlds opens itself up for millions of users to join, Meta needs to prove that it\u2019s capable of keeping a social platform safe.\n\nTo run Horizon Worlds, you\u2019ll need to download the free app on a Quest 2 device. As of January 13, 2022, it will no longer be supported on Quest 1.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/metas-horizon-worlds-is-available-in-the-us-and-canada-for-18-users/"},
{"title": "Flink, the Berlin-based instant grocery startup, is now valued at $2.85B after raising $750M in a round led by DoorDash", "author": "Ingrid Lunden", "published_at": "2021-12-09 22:03:48", "content": "Instant grocery delivery continues to be a very frothy market, but today comes news of a major funding round for one player in it that investors believe will still be standing after the hype has died down.\n\nFlink, the Berlin-based startup that sells food and other essentials at supermarket prices and aims to deliver them in less than 10 minutes, has confirmed that it has raised $750 million, a Series B round of funding led by a strategic backer, DoorDash, made at a pre-money valuation of $2.1 billion ($2.85 billion post-money). Flink is already present in some 60 cities across four countries, where it covers 10 million customers; the plan will be to use the funding to continue growing that footprint, both organically and potentially by snapping up rivals (we have confirmed that most of the round is in equity, with a small portion in debt for acquisitions).\n\nThe involvement of DoorDash \u2014 which went public in December 2020, has a market cap currently of just under $57 billion and is making its first foray into Europe with this investment (a \u20ac7 billion deal to buy Wolt in Finland has not closed; projected date for that is the second half of 2022) \u2014 was a badly kept secret in this fundraise, with reports of the investment emerging several months ago. We can confirm that DoorDash\u2019s investment officially closed in September, with the rest of the round completed in the months following.\n\nOthers in the round included previous backer Mubadala Capital (which backed Flink in a $240 million round made as recently as June) and other unnamed new and past investors. (Previous backers also include German supermarket giant REWE, Prosus, Bond, Target Global, Northzone, Cherry Ventures and TriplePoint Capital.)\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable when you consider the size of the funding is that Flink has only been around for a year, and commercially active for just seven months. In a rare interview \u2014 the company has been media-shy up to now \u2014 CEO and co-founder Oliver Merkel said he believes that part of the reason Flink has attracted attention among what is a crowded field of instant delivery startups is because of the founders\u2019 track records. Merkel spent years as a management consultant at Bain working in grocery and retail; co-founders Julian Dames and Christoph Cordes are Rocket Internet alums who respectively founded the Foodora food delivery startup and furniture e-commerce business Fashion for Home (acquired by Home24, where Cordes became CEO).\n\n\u201cI think what we bring and why could we win market leadership in such a short amount of time is because we are obsessed about how we do things\u2026 and we bring some experience to the table. We made so many mistakes elsewhere, and we hope we\u2019ve learned from those,\u201d Merkel said. (Another reason for wooing investors could be that he\u2019s quite personable for a media-shy person; that last comment was delivered tongue-in-cheek, as were many of the other quips he made off the record.)\n\nThis round has been in the works for some months now and the story behind that speaks to volatility and hype in the market at the moment, and where Flink believes it stands out.\n\nDoorDash had originally come to Berlin last summer looking at investing in Gorillas, one of Flink\u2019s big rivals, but that deal fell through over differences between the two companies\u2019 management styles and longer-term growth plans. So, DoorDash began talking with Flink, where it turned out executives were more aligned in their strategies and approaches to growth. (Gorillas instead raised money from another strategic, Delivery Hero, as part of a whopping $1 billion round.)\n\nFlink, meanwhile, fresh off its own funding round, was flirting with M&A. Specifically, the startup had been tapped by both e-commerce and delivery behemoth Amazon, as well as by another U.S. instant grocery delivery player Gopuff, as an acquisition target.\n\nBoth approaches didn\u2019t go anywhere \u2014 depending on who you ask, because Flink\u2019s valuation was too high; or because Flink wasn\u2019t interested in selling. At the same time, Flink was also looking at a potential merger with Gorillas \u2014 a massive consolidation play that also didn\u2019t happen at the time.\n\nWhether Gorillas and Flink do ultimately join up, consolidation will likely come one way or the other as the many companies in instant delivery that have popped up in the last couple of years \u2014 spurred by the pandemic and changes in how people shopped and moved around \u2014 struggle to get profitable, reach positive unit economics, find new customers and raise more money. Gopuff has been buying up smaller instant delivery startups in Europe to expand and scale, as has Getir.\n\nAnd we found out too that Flink itself came close to buying another instant delivery company, Cajoo in France, apparently for the grand sum of \u20ac1, before Cajoo instead opted to raise $40 million.\n\n(TechCrunch has confirmed the above details with executives across the companies.)\n\nPutting all that M&A intrigue to one side, though, Flink has been quietly building out a strategy for how it plans to tackle the market, and it starts with how it sources groceries.\n\nE-commerce is a business of economies of scale \u2014 it\u2019s one reason why it\u2019s so hard ultimately to compete against the behemoth that is Amazon \u2014 and the same goes for groceries, which need to be procured by the retailers that sell them.\n\nRather than try to get to a big enough scale to have the best negotiating power for buying in goods, Flink\u2019s approach has been instead to partner with huge retailers and lean on them for those deals. In Germany, that has been its strategic backer REWE, and it has followed the same route with its launches in France and the Netherlands, although Flink has declined to disclose so far who those partners are.\n\n\u201cFlink is on a dynamic growth track, which REWE Group is supporting with its long-term commitment,\u201d said Lionel Souque, CEO of REWE Group, in a statement on the relationship. \u201cThis also includes the operational cooperation between Flink and Rewe in the area of purchasing, which continues to develop very positively. Our decision to partner with Flink in April of this year has proven to be successful; Flink is now the number one in Quick Commerce in Germany and is ideally placed to further expand their market leadership.\u201d (As for why a supermarket giant would be interested in a company that is essentially a rival, the logic was explained to me like this: those big supermarkets missed the boat on hard discount rivals like Aldi and Lidl, where they didn\u2019t anticipate just how competitive the latter would ultimately become, taking away chunks of market share and customers. Now, the idea is to avoid making the same mistake and instead collaborate earlier and more closely with the next big thing to stay abreast of whatever growth might come.)\n\nIn the process of growing, the aim for Flink has been to keep the concept of instant grocery delivery as normal as possible and delivered to as wide a range of consumers as possible, not just young urbanites with disposable cash.\n\n\u201cPeople in big cities are spoiled,\u201d Merkel said. \u201cThey get all the new innovations and services, but when we opened in Regensburg\u201d \u2014 a significantly smaller town in the south of the country where Flink is now also operating \u2014 \u201cit was crazy, the amount of business we got from day one. It\u2019s an indication that our model works everywhere. We want to be the supermarket for everyone. Our pricing is supermarket pricing, and our products appeal not just to hipsters but the fireman, the teacher. Normal people.\u201d It currently offers some 2,500 items in its biggest markets, and following its wide-appeal approach, that selection likely will grow over time.\n\nWhat will be worth watching also is how Flink grows its talent. At a moment when there remains a lot of scrutiny \u2014 and potentially some big changes ahead \u2014 over the rights that gig workers have at the companies where they operate, Flink says that its focus is \u201cfully employed riders with unlimited contracts at a massive scale to cope with customer demand.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe company says that on average, its customers are taking multiple orders each week, an engagement metric that caught the eye of DoorDash and will be something to watch as part of how the two companies potentially collaborate together in the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been impressed by Flink\u2019s growth and customer retention,\u201d said Prabir Adarkar, CFO of DoorDash, in a statement. \u201cOliver, Julian, Christoph, and their team share our operator mindset and bring a wealth of industry experience. It\u2019s not surprising that in less than a year of operating they have established themselves as the leader in key European markets.\u201d \n\n\u201cThis funding round is a watershed moment for Flink as it continues on its hyper growth trajectory,\u201d added Amer Alaily of Mubadala. \u201cWe are excited to watch them disrupt the instant grocery delivery space amidst an enormous market opportunity in Germany, France, the Netherlands and beyond \u2014 and we look forward to remaining a trusted partner to Oliver, Julian, Christoph and their team.\u201d\u00a0", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/flink-the-berlin-based-instant-grocery-startup-is-now-valued-at-2-85b-after-raising-750m-in-a-round-led-by-doordash/"},
{"title": "Breakout Ventures has a new, $112.5 million fund, backed by Tony Fadell, Chris Sacca and others", "author": "Connie Loizos", "published_at": "2021-12-09 23:54:18", "content": "Breakout Ventures, a San Francisco-based seed- and Series A-stage venture firm that funds what it calls creative biosciences startups, has closed the second fund in its five-year history with $112.5 million in capital commitments.\n\nBoth of its funds, including a $60 million debut effort that we wrote about in 2017, are backed by Dolby Family Ventures, the Thiel Foundation, GRIDS Capital, S Cubed Capital, Chris and Crystal Sacca, Tony Fadell and Zack Bogue and Matt Ocko of DCVC.\n\nThe new fund also pulled in new institutional LPs, including Cortes Capital and Cupola Funds managed by AMG National Trust.\n\nWhat its high-wattage backers are betting on are two managing partners who\u2019ve long focused on startups at the intersection of biology and technology.\n\nLindy Fishburne, a management consultant earlier in her career, spent more than a decade as the executive director of the Thiel Foundation, which awarded no-strings-attached grants to deep science startups until it became obvious to Fishburne that, given what she was seeing, it was time to start writing venture checks instead.\n\nJulia Moore was meanwhile an associate director at Stanford University before joining the Thiel Foundation as a portfolio director and joining forces with Fishburne afterward at Breakout Ventures. (Moore was promoted to managing partner earlier this year; the Thiel Foundation\u2019s model has since been retired as the two build out the Breakout Ventures footprint.)\n\nNaturally, the bets the two are making were also critical to the fundraising process, and there was apparently plenty of progress to report, with a portfolio that features a number of highly valued startups.\n\nAmong these is Modern Meadow, a company known mostly for its lab-grown leather and that closed on $130 million in Series C funding back in April (at an undisclosed valuation). Breakout Ventures also wrote one of the first checks to Cytovale, a San Francisco-based company that has gone on to raise $50 million and is currently in the final stages of clinical trials of a new test for sepsis that generates results in less than 10 minutes. (Sepsis is the leading cause of death in hospitals, notes Fishburne.)\n\nA third company from that first fund is Checkerspot, a company using synthetic biology and chemistry to produce novel bio-derived oils. Like Cytovale, it has now raised $50 million altogether, including from Viking Global Investors.\n\nBreakout Ventures was an early investor in Cortexyme. The now publicly traded company is developing therapies for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, though it encountered a related setback in October that sent it shares diving, and they have yet to recover.\n\nAltogether, say the two, their portfolio companies have gone on to raise more than $1 billion in follow-on capital and grants. They expect the pace to pick up quickly from here, too, fueled in part by the coronavirus pandemic. Asked about the effect on Breakout by the development of vaccines to treat COVID-19, both investors say the impact was both abrupt and enduring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been gas on the fire,\u201d says Fishburne. \u201cFor the world to see how central science is and its capacity to now be able to move so quickly and be so responsive driven by the tools of scale that are now available, that has [created an] enormous on-ramp for our companies and the places that we play.\u201d\n\nShe points, as one example, to a portfolio company called Phylagen, a San Francisco-based biotech company that combines microbial genomics and data analytics to solve complex problems like pandemic management and supply chain verification and which is currently working with several large tech companies to ensure their employees and customers that their offices are safe.\n\nMoore echoes the point. \u201cWhat we saw with Moderna and what we\u2019re seeing at the board level is that [companies\u2019] ability to code a vaccine over a weekend permanently changed the pace of innovation in biosciences. The pace at which we see our companies monitoring timelines is moving [faster] because they have more actionable information and can iterate on that information at a speed we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nSeemingly, Breakout Ventures is also moving quickly. Already, the firm has invested in three companies with its new fund, including Parthenon Therapeutics, a two-year-old, Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech that\u2019s developing anti-cancer therapies and which just last week announced $65 million in Series A funding.\n\nAsked how Parthenon fits into Breakout\u2019s broader thesis, Moore notes that while Parthenon looks like a traditional therapeutics company, it\u2019s \u201cdoing a lot of really interesting biomarker work. They\u2019re working with a novel hypothesis. They have an interdisciplinary team that can do multiple different modalities.\u201d\n\nWhile tried-and-true biotech investors led the deal \u2014 in this case, Pfizer and Northpond Ventures \u2014 Breakout Ventures is already thinking differently about less traditional partnerships for the company. Says Moore: \u201cWe\u2019re the ones asking: How do you move faster in looking at the pipeline with pathology and AI?\u201d\n\nPictured above: the Breakout Ventures team, with Moore and Fishburne pictured at top, left to right.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/breakout-ventures-has-a-new-112-5-million-fund-backed-by-tony-fadell-chris-sacca-and-others/"},
{"title": "Maev secures $9M; will have your dog howling for more of its raw pet food", "author": "Christine Hall", "published_at": "2021-12-10 06:00:09", "content": "As consumers think more about what they are putting in their bodies, they are also thinking about what they are feeding their pets. Driven by the global pandemic and everyone being at home with their pets, sales topped $100 billion in 2020 in this sector.\n\nAustin-based Maev, developing human-grade raw dog food, is poised to take a share of the raw food category, announcing today it raised $9 million in a round of funding led by Springdale Ventures. The company previously raised undisclosed rounds backed by VMG Partners, Bolt and Willow Growth.\n\nThe idea for the direct-to-consumer pet care brand was sparked in 2018 by CEO Katie Spies and Christine Busaba. Prior to starting the company, Spies started her career as an engineer, stacking up three degrees. She worked at a startup as a product development manager, but ultimately left that behind to find a different calling. It was during that time that she became a dog walker and realized what was needed in the dog food space.\n\nThough they officially started the company in 2019, Busaba and Spies didn\u2019t launch their first product, the raw dog food, until 2020. The pandemic initially affected Maev\u2019s ability to get started. The company had four employees and had to shift its launch plans and even push back its funding round, she said. It ended up working out, and today, it has added supplemental vitamin bars and bone broth topper to its product pipeline.\n\nThe food products were created alongside a team of veterinary nutritionists and clinically tested to address nutritional gaps for a healthier dog. The frozen food is made with real meats, vegetables and fruits and unlike competitor brands that have to be thawed, Maev\u2019s products are ready-to-eat out of the freezer, Spies said.\n\n\u201cWe started with three products, but we are building the future of pet care,\u201d she added. \u201cThis grocery aisle had little innovation. There are some great products, but pet parents have accepted that healthier products mean being harder to use. We aim to make products easier and great for your dog.\u201d\n\nMaev sells its food as a subscription product, with costs averaging about $2 per meal. Over the past year, the company acquired about 2,000 customers and has 16 employees and 11 open jobs. During that time, the company has been growing both its revenue and customer bases, investing in supply chain and solidifying its innovation.\n\nNow with the new capital in hand, Spies plans to \u201cput a foot on the gas\u201d to push its 20% month over month growth to 25%. In the next year, the company will be selling its products in an omnichannel capacity with a focus on customer retention. It is already seeing 92% of customers stick around after their first box, a statistic Spies explained is not seen frequently in other pet food brands, where the industry average is 60%.\n\nShe expects to invest the new capital in its headquarters move to Austin, brand awareness and hiring across marketing and supply chain. One of the company\u2019s biggest customer requests is a chicken product, and plans are in the works to have one available in three months. Spies expects that addition to outsell its current beef product.\n\nWith 95 million dogs in the U.S. Spies notes the company has plenty of room to grow. There are 112 fresh pet food companies with new entrants shaking up the market over the past few years, she said. Maev is one of the latest to attract venture-backed funding, joining Alpha Paw and Jinx in announcing new raises in the past two months.\n\nMeanwhile, pet food incumbents are also putting a paw print in the healthier food space: Freshpet launched its Spring & Sprout vegetarian dog food in September and Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition announced a partnership with Bond Pet Foods last month to create meat proteins via fermentation for pet food applications.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really interesting to watch the market evolve,\u201d Spies said. \u201cToday, it is great that more dog owners are educated on some of the problems with standard kibble and are skeptical about what they are feeding their dogs. However, when you boil down all of the decisions you make about your dog, this is the most important one for health and longevity.\u201d\n\nThat attention to detail and care for pets is what attracted many of Maev\u2019s investors to jump on board.\n\n\u201cWe are highly particular and prescriptive in considering brands to bring into the VMG portfolio, making our investments sparse, yet strategic in those companies that have what it takes to become iconic brands,\u201d said Carle Stenmark, partner at VMG Partners, in a written statement. \u201cWe were immediately drawn to Maev by its incredibly engaged and vocal customer base, as well as our alignment with Katie, who we believe is a world-class founder setting the standard for the next-generation of pet care.\u201d\n\n\u201cInnovation in our space doesn\u2019t just mean new products in different formats or packaging; instead, it\u2019s looking at the consumer\u2019s life and finding ways to exceed their expectations and enhance their daily routines, which includes their loved ones and furry friends,\u201d added Dan Graham, co-founder and general partner of Springdale Ventures. \u201cOutside of being a fantastic product at the leading edge of the better-for-you pet food movement, Katie\u2019s passion and determination for changing the lives of pets and their owners is a journey on which we\u2019re excited to be, especially as our first investment into the pet space, with more to come.\u201d", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/maev-dog-raw-pet-food/"},

The round saw participation from \u201call existing investors,\u201d including Akamai Technologies and Glasswing Ventures, as well as new investors Allstate and the Minderoo Foundation\u2019s Frontier Technology Initiative.\n\nTechCrunch reported in late October that the three-year-old Inrupt was in talks to raise between $30 million to $50 million.\n\nInrupt \u2014 founded by the creator of the standards of the world wide web, Berners-Lee, and technologist John Bruce \u2014 is attempting to \u201creshape the internet\u201d by building a platform that gives users control of their data. The Inrupt team includes cryptography expert Bruce Schneier.\n\n\u201cBusiness transformation is hampered by different parts of one\u2019s life being managed by different silos, each of which looks after one vertical slice of life,\u201d said Berners-Lee in a statement. \u201cMeanwhile, that data is exploited by the silo in question, leading to increasing, very reasonable, public skepticism about how personal data is being misused.\u201d\n\nInrupt\u2019s platform enables users to store their personal data in something called a POD (Personal Online Datastores). These PODs are interoperable with decentrealized applications and can be decoupled whenever the user prefers to do so. Inrupt believes, it said in an investor pitch obtained by TechCrunch, that it is attempting to emulate the core infrastructure of companies such as Visa for credit card processing and Verisign, which commercialized the DNS standard.\n\n\u201cThis approach allows consumers to take control of their data while giving governments and companies \u2014 and their app developers \u2014 a more seamless transition into a new internet era and regulatory regime (e.g., GDPR),\u201d wrote Hunter Hartwell, principal at Forte Ventures, in a blog post.\n\n\u201cOur thesis for the investment in Inrupt is a simple one: consumers, governments, and many companies are eager to move towards a truly open and collaborative web (aka Web3), and Inrupt\u2019s enterprise Solid server (ESS) represents the most technically advanced and commercially viable path to realizing that future. Embedded in our thesis is the belief that this top-tier team is uniquely qualified to meet the requirements and expectations of government and corporate partners, as well as the broader public,\u201d he added.\n\nInrupt\u2019s customers include governments and enterprises. The startup has signed contracts with governments of Sweden, Argentina and Basque, TechCrunch reported earlier. It generated $225,000 in revenue last year, and $200,000 in revenue in September, the report said.\n\nThe startup will deploy the funds to \u201cexpand its global footprint of Solid deployments in both the government sector and the commercial sector,\u201d said Hartwell.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/tim-berners-lee-inrupt-fundraise/"},

He also faces a number of charges under the controversial Espionage Act.\n\nIn all he faces 18 counts connected with \u201cobtaining and disclosing defence and national security material\u201d through the WikiLeaks website, primarily in 2009 and 2010 but also \u201cto some extent since\u201d, per a court summary.\n\nDefenders of the polarizing figure argue he\u2019s being persecuted for telling truth to power and that his extradition would have a chilling effect on journalism \u2014 given the U.S. government is pursuing charges that include publishing classified information.\n\nAssange obtained the information from former U.S. Army solider and whistleblower Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, who disclosed hundreds of thousands of classified or sensitive military and diplomatic documents that Assange then published via WikiLeaks \u2014 causing huge embarrassment for the U.S. government.\n\nThe leaked material included army reports and videos of airstrikes, including instances of civilian deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with hundreds of thousands of U.S. diplomatic cables.\n\nIn a\u00a0summary of the judgement issued today, the U.K. High Court said it has accepted a package of assurances from the U.S. government related to the previous district judge\u2019s concerns that Assange is a suicide risk.\n\nThe Court said four assurances have been offered, adding that is \u201csatisfied\u201d the assurances exclude the possibility of Assange being subject to \u201cspecial administrative measures\u201d \u2014 or held at a maximum security prison in Florence, Colorado, USA (either pretrial or after any conviction) vis-\u00e0-vis the acts he is currently accused of committing.\n\nThe U.S. has also agreed to consent to an application by Assange to be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence if he is convicted; and agreed that while he is in custody in the U.S. he will receive \u201cappropriate clinical and psychological treatment as recommended by a qualified treating clinician at the prison where he is held\u201d, per the Court summary.\n\n\u201cThe court rejected various criticisms of those assurances which were argued on Mr Assange\u2019s behalf, and was satisfied that the assurances were sufficient to meet the concerns which led to the DJ\u2019s decision,\u201d it adds.\n\nA final decision on whether to allow Assange\u2019s extradition will pass to the U.K.\u2019s home secretary, Priti Patel \u2014 failing a successful appeal of the High Court\u2019s decision.\n\nSky News has reported that Assange\u2019s legal team intends to seek an appeal at the Supreme Court, and has 14 days to file an application.\n\nAlmost a decade ago the British computer hacker Gary McKinnon was saved from extradition to the U.S. to face charges of hacking into military computers after the then home secretary, Theresa May, denied the application on human rights grounds.\n\nAssange, who holds an Australian passport, is not a British national.\n\nHe was previously granted citizenship by Ecuador, in 2018 \u2014 in a failed attempt to get him out of the country\u2019s embassy where he had fled in 2012 to avoid being extradited to Sweden where he faced allegations of rape and sexual assault.\n\nThose charges were subsequently dropped, but in 2019 Ecuador withdrew his asylum and he was arrested by London\u2019s Met Police for breaching bail conditions in the U.K. by seeking political refuge at the embassy.\n\nEarlier this year Ecuador also stripped Assange of his citizenship.\n\nThis report was updated with details of Assange\u2019s legal team\u2019s planned appeal to the Supreme Court.", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/us-wins-assange-extradition-appeal/"},

The battle is not going to end anytime soon.\u201d\n\nRouter Protocol\u2019s other offering is Dfyn, which is a decentralized exchange, like Uniswap or Pancake Swap, that is built on top of Polygon. \u201cIt\u2019s like we have a bunch of airport terminals called Dfyn, and then we have airline routes that connect these Dyfn networks. But they also connect other airports. That\u2019s the beauty of the whole model.\u201d\n\nRamachandran said he expects cross-chain solutions to become more popular next year. \u201cLet\u2019s imagine you\u2019re on Solana blockchain and you want to sell Ethereum, but you see much better prices on Binance Smart Chain. Router will enable you to do get the best price on Binance Smart Chain with one click and bring it back to your native blockchain, which is Solana,\u201d he said.\n\nTrading is the most popular use case on Router Protocol today, but Ramachandran said he expects many more applications to make inroads in the future. \u201cOnce you speak across borders, you can not just trade, but borrow, lend and do cross-chain governance. Sushi, for instance, has 15 chains and 15 different communities. To get a community vote across these chains is a nightmare as you will be required to do 15 different snapshots. So that is something we can solve. You can borrow from one chain, and lend on another,\u201d he said.\n\nThe firm plans to deploy the capital to scale its product offerings and also invest in multiple security audits, it said.\n\n\u201cGetting blockchains to communicate effectively with each other is the holy grail for DeFi going forward, and we are happy to work with the team behind Router & Dfyn and support their unique approach to solving this problem,\u201d said Darius Sit, co-founder of QCP Capital, in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate future Web 3.0 activity across several multi-purpose and application-specific blockchains. Router\u2019s XCLP will be an important cross-chain infrastructure solution enabling the flow of liquidity across chains. We are delighted to back and support the Router team in their efforts in this direction.\u201d", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/10/coinbase-ventures-backs-cross-chain-infra-router-protocol/"},
{"title": "Officely raises $2M to help hybrid teams coordinate office time right in Slack", "author": "Greg Kumparak", "published_at": "2021-12-09 13:32:45", "content": "So your company is going WFH/Office hybrid. Great! Working from home more rules, even if management decisions or the specifics of your role mean it can\u2019t happen every day.\n\nNow, how do you coordinate who goes in the office and when? Does it have to be the same day(s) every week? Do you just pick a random day and hope there\u2019s a desk open? What if you\u2019re the only one who went in that day \u2014 did you really need to commute? Do we track all this in a spreadsheet, or do we need a whole separate tool just to keep track of it?\n\nOfficely wants to handle it all right through a tool many teams are already on anyway: Slack. They\u2019ve just raised a $2 million seed round to grow from here.\n\nOfficely\u2019s main draw is desk booking, allowing you to group desks by which office they\u2019re in \u2014 or, if you\u2019ve got a bunch of desks, into \u201cneighborhoods\u201d within an office. You can see how many people are going in to an office on any given day, see if there\u2019s a desk open for you, and join if so. There\u2019s also a few other customizations, like flagging if anyone is bringing a dog into the office on each day \u2014 for the folks who might want to stay home because of allergies or, if you\u2019re like me, only want to go into the office when there\u2019s at least one dog there.\n\nYou can set up customizable health screening surveys to make sure no one has a fever or known exposures, and have it automatically remind people to fill out the survey on the morning they\u2019re expected to come in. If someone gets sick, Officely can also help with contact tracing, building a list of the employees who were in the office on the same days.\n\nThey\u2019ve also recently been experimenting with an \u201cOffice Chat\u201d feature, which automatically creates a new Slack room at the beginning of a day, invites everyone who is scheduled to be in that day, then archives it at the end of the day. Great for figuring out lunch plans without bugging everyone back at home.\n\nI fired up a test instance of Officely, and it was really quite smooth. The UI for customizing some things away from their defaults can feel a bit buried, but that\u2019s mostly because they\u2019re working within the boundaries of being a Slack app \u2014 but they also do a bunch of neat stuff I didn\u2019t even realize Slack apps can do. Team TC isn\u2019t spending much time in the office right now so I couldn\u2019t stress test it super hard, but I liked what I saw enough that we\u2019ll probably give it a spin if/when we return to the office.\n\nOfficely is currently free for small teams, with the free plan capped at 10 employees and one office. If you\u2019ve got more employees or more offices, they\u2019ll charge $2.50 per office employee per month (\u201cWe only ever charge for your employees that use Officely to book into the office,\u201d they note.) Once you grow past 500 employees, they offer custom pricing plans.\n\nSo why build the whole thing within Slack? \u201cThe interesting challenge with desk booking tools is the software has to be adopted by everyone in the company to be effective,\u201d co-founder Max Shepherd-Cross tells me. Convincing everybody to onboard onto some new web app is tough; Slack, meanwhile, is where many companies\u2019 mishmash of teams are already used to coming together.\n\nOfficely is a pivot; the team started back in 2017 with a different focus: hotel room booking. \u201cWe just got crushed by COVID. Overnight, we lost all of our customers,\u201d says Shepherd-Cross. \u201cAfter crying into our pillows for a couple of weeks, we had the realization that offices of the future are going to be run like hotels of the past. [\u2026] The whole booking infrastructure we\u2019d spent the previous four years building for hotels, we now need for offices.\u201d\n\nThis round was led by TEN13, and backed by angel investors Vu Tran (co-founder of learning platform Go1) and Adam Schwab (CEO of travel co. Luxury Escapes).", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/officely-raises-2m-to-help-hybrid-teams-coordinate-office-time-right-in-slack/"}
